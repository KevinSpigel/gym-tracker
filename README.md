# Gym Tracker

This project was developed as part of the Coder House Javascript course.

Project status: it meets the logical requirements for course evaluation.
The use of javascript logic was prioritized over web design.

## Description
This is a Gym Tracker. It helps you track your exercises and also has a chronometer to improve your training.

Once logged in, you have access to the scorecard.
The user can select the entry date and the type of exercise.
Once those inputs are selected, the user can proceed to load the exercises performed. It's possible to add as many entries as the user wants or delete them.
